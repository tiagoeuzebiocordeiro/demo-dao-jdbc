# JDBC Demo project with DAO pattern
This was a project using the DAO design pattern. Basically some operations (insert, deleteById, update, findAll, findByDepartment, findById) with the Seller entity.
The project also includes the Department entity, but it wasn't implemented, since my goal was just to learn a bit about JDBC.
